'''
Abstract class for representing a general allele variation.
The abstract class provides two abstract method (not implemented by the astract class),
i.e. isTransition() and isTransition().
AlleleVariation can be said a CLASS INTERFACE as it is an abstrac class whose methods are all abstracts.
The distinction between abstract class and class interface is simple: a class interface is an abstract class
whose methods are all declared abstracts. We remenind that an abstract class can have some implemented method 
as it can be defined as a class having at least 1 abstract method.
